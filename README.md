Hi, I'm JessFr12!
I'm interested in Computer Engineering. Aside from that, I love playing video games and spending time with my family!
I am currently improving my skills towards Java, SQL, RESTful APIs, and many more to expand my knowledge. So far it is going very well and I'm excited for what's to come.
